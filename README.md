# Trading-App

Welcome to the Trading App prototype! This application provides users with real-time data for various company stocks, allowing them to make informed decisions on buying and selling. If the stock price meets the user's criteria, the app will send a signal to buy or sell stocks according to the user's specified limit. Additionally, users can obtain the cost of the stock based on the current price when a signal is sent.
